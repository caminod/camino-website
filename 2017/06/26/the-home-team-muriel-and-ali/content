		<p>Muriel is Steve&#8217;s other half and Jenni and Ali&#8217;s mum. She is a long term ME sufferer but manages it fairly well and has held down many teaching jobs as well as getting a PhD a few years back.</p>
Ali in Edinburgh, May 2017
<p>Alister (Ali) is 19 and has had chronic severe ME since he was 15. An enthusiastic footballer, and former goalkeeper in the local junior team, he got ill in August 2013.  Here he&#8217;s on a rare trip out of his house to the very nearby coffee shop to celebrate Jenni&#8217;s end of term.  As you can tell, Ali is not best pleased about being in the limelight.</p>
