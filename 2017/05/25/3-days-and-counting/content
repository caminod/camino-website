Steve: I was ready for this about a month ago.  Not so sure now…

Last week whilst walking around London I did ‘something’ to my left foot. To my 2nd metatarsal to be precise.  I came back home to Perthshire and limped from doctor’s appointments to x-rays at Perthshire Royal Infirmary and visits to various podiatrists.  As of the last podiatrist appointment, yesterday afternoon, I have bits and pieces glued to the insoles of my Merrell Chameleon and Salewa walking shoes.  These additions appeared to work and I danced a very bad jig.

In my, ahem, training for the Camino I’ve been trying to walk at least 10km on 6 days in a week.  That’s been easy – I have two large dogs that need the exercise and nag me incessantly to get out of the house, and Perthshire is a splendid place to go for a walk.

But last night I took my beleaguered left foot out for another 10km walk and managed only 6 before deciding it wasn’t a good idea.  Is 790km (that’s 500 miles for you who prefer old money) do-able?

So…

Sunday morning at 7:05am we are due on a plane from Edinburgh to Biarritz.  As of the time of writing I’m going.
